ABRT Project Documentation
==========================

ABRT is a set of tools to help users detect and report application crashes. Its main
purpose is to ease the process of reporting an issue and finding a solution.

The solution in this context might be a bug tracker ticket, a knowledge base article
or suggestion to update a package to a version containing a fix.
